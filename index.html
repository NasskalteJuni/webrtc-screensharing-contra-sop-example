            <h2>About this Page</h2>
            <p>
                This page serves as a sample to demonstrate, how screen capture may break the Same Origin Policy,
                or to be more precise, that a website can access information from another website without the other website and and the user being aware of this.
                It will be probably not exploitable in away like getting session IDs to hijack a session but may serve as a help for social engineering,
                giving away maybe private information of a user profile page like username, date of birth and place of residence.
                To access this information, this page makes use of the nature of iframes, which accept browser stored cookies for the displayed site,
                therefore showing a logged in page view if the user is currently logged in in another tab and the non-standard http-header,
                X-FRAME-OPTIONS not being set to SAME_ORIGIN by default, thus allowing pages to be embedded by an iframe.
                If we are able to display this information, we may use screen capture in a kind of feature hijacking way.
                We use it to make a screenshot of our frame and use an optical character recognition (OCR) to react to expected keywords.
                Then, we may send the full text or possibly the words after the keywords, since a page may have a listing of personal information in the form of
                "username: name", and so on and send them to the web server where we can use them for other purposes against the user.
                We have the advantage, that we have to flash this iframe just for a few milliseconds while we make the screenshot, so the user may not be able to notice it.
            </p>
            <p> For the different browsers, here are some advices that may help getting screen capture to work since it is possibly not a standard feature</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firefox: You may be prompted to whitelist this page, click on the accept-option</li>
                <li>Chrome: You may have to start chrome from the command line with the flag <code>â€“enable-usermedia-screen-capturing</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Use the following form to enter a website URL that you are logged in, maybe a profile page and if you want a comma separated list of keywords.
                An attacker has to guess if some of the users of his malicious page also visit the URL you typed in but he may be able to guess successfully.
