            <h2>About this Page</h2>
            <p>
                This page serves as an example how screen capture could weaken the Same Origin Policy,
                or to be more precise, that a website can access information from another website without the other website and and the user being necessary aware of this.
                To get to the demonstration part, just click <a href="#form">here</a>, further explanation on the attack follows.
                The attack will be probably not exploitable,not like getting session IDs to hijack a session (which was possible in the past by showing the embedded page source code in an iFrame),
                but may serve as a help for social engineering, giving away maybe private information of a user profile page like username, date of birth and place of residence.
                I was inspired to create this demonstration by the paper of Yuan Tian, Ying-Chuan Liu, Amar Bhosale, Lin-Shung Huang,Patrick Tague,Collin Jackson of the Carnegie Mellon University,
                with the great title <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2014/papers/AllYourScreensareBelongtoUs_c_AttacksExploitingtheHTML5ScreenSharingAPI.pdf">
                "All Your Screens are Belong to Us: Attacks Exploiting the HTML5 Screen Sharing API" </a>.
                The security hole that made XSRF attacks possible is already closed, but the basic idea of breaking Same Origin Policy remains.
                On this page, I just tried to get Information from other websites.
                I have a model of four relevant instances in this attempt:
                <ul>
                    <li> a <i>"Victim Page" (VP)</i>, which contains somehow interesting or exploitable information </li>
                    <li> a <i>"Malicious Trusted Page" (MTP)</i>, which is a website that is allowed screen capture by the user for legitimate reasons, but abuses this right to do things not obvious to the user, described here</li>
                    <li> a <i>"Limited User" (LU)</i>, who is limited in sight, does not recognise swiftly flashing images and does not expect the MTP to behave maliciously </li>
                    <li> an <i>"Attacker" (A)</i>, who can configure the MTP for his attack (by cross site scripting, gaining access to the page server in some way, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                For the attempt to be successful, I have these premises:
                <ul>
                    <li> the LU must allow screen capture to the MTP for some reason</li>
                    <li> the A guessed correctly that the LU visits the VP and knows at least the VP URL</li>
                    <li> the LU does <strong>not</strong> have to switch to the browser tab with the VP and can remain completely on the MTP</li>
                    <li> the LU is logged in on the VP</li>
                    <li> the VP has not set the X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP custom header field </li>
                </ul>
                To gain access to VP information, this MTP example makes use of the nature of iFrames, which accept browser stored cookies for the displayed VP,
                therefore showing a logged in page view if the LU is currently logged in in another tab.
                If we are able to display this information, we may use screen capture in a kind of feature hijacking way.
                We use it to make a screenshot of our frame and the MTP can send the picture over a HTTP-Request or any way to the server of the MTP,
                where the A can post process the information of the image.
                But we can also use an optical character recognition (OCR) to react to expected keywords.
                We can even get the full text or possibly the words after the keywords, since a page may have a listing of personal information in the form of
                "username: name", and so on. I will do this as an example and display the results here, if keywords are given.
                We have the advantage, that we have to flash this iFrame just for a few milliseconds while we make the screenshot, so the user may not be able to notice it.
                To demonstrate the described attack, insert the 'guessed URL' of the VP, a URL where you are currently logged in.
            </p>
            <p> Here is some advice for different browsers that may help getting screen capture to work since it is possibly not a standard feature</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firefox: You may be prompted to whitelist this page, click on the accept-option</li>
                <li>Chrome: You may have to start chrome from the command line with the flag <code>â€“enable-usermedia-screen-capturing</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Use the following form to enter a website URL that you are logged in, maybe a profile page and if you want a comma separated list of keywords.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Problems: </h2>
                There is a chance that the demonstration will fail due to a delay in the MediaStream processing.
                In this case, the screen capture is activated, the VP is opened in an iFrame,
                but the stream is a little bit delayed and still shows the before-open view when capturing the frame.
                Due to this, only the MTP is captured. A better success rate could be reached,
                if one can determine when the stream shows the VP and start the capture after this or if one exposes the VP for a longer time.
                This would increase the chance of being noticed due to the attempt being more visible.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Conclusion: </h2>
                The described attack is always visible and can be noticed. It needs a very trustful user, but not someone, who acts completely without reason.
                It relies pretty much on luck, having a user being locked in on a VP that has no X-FRAME-OPTIONS header,
                which is not uncommon so it would take a long time to use it on a single, specific user.
                But for hundreds of users, it may work well enough. The extracted data is probably not worth very much,
                since the option to show the page source code in an iFrame with possible Nonces or SessionIDs is not possible any more.
                Besides this, not all browsers even support screen sharing.
                All in all, it may break the Same Origin Policy at some point, but it is rather harmless and not reliably exploitable.
